Hunter & Shaman

•	This is a card game where you should either leave the horse alive or kill it depending on your role.

•	There are three decks of cards: color cards (12 black and 12 red), role reversal cards (6 cards), and horses (2 black and 2 red).

•	There are two roles: hunter and shaman 

•	Every horse has a HP. At the beginning, the horse has one HP and can be maximized to two . At the end of the draw, if the horse has more than 0 HP, two points are added to the shaman, otherwise two points are added to the hunter.

•	A player's turn can be made using one of the following cards: red card  black card and role reversal card 

•	The horse can be red or black

•	Each horse gets plus one HP if its color is the same with playing card and minus one if the color does not match.

•	Role reversal card changes the roles between the players.

•	Each new draw puts a new horse on the table that will be played during the next three moves. It does not matter who will go first, each player in the total for the entire draw must use three cards.

•	If at the end of the draw the player still has a role reversal card, he puts it on the table and gets one point for it.

•	Before the next draw players draw cards on their hand so that each player has three color cards and one role reversal card.

•	The entire game lasts until one side wins two rounds. A maximum of three rounds are played, meaning there can also be a draw. A new deck of cards is played each round.
